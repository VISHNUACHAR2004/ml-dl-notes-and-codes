    "##### In traditional machine learning, We had to manually define “features” — like edges, corners, color histograms.\n",
    "- ##### That was slow, limited, and error-prone.\n",

    "   -  Huge image sizes\n",
    "   -  Complex visual patterns\n",
    "   -  Different positions, lighting, and backgrounds\n",
    "   - That’s why CNNs power almost every visual AI task today — from face recognition, self-driving cars, and medical imaging to object detection in videos."
